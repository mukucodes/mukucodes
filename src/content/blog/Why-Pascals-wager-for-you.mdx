Ever wonder, why are here? why should you go out for shopping today instead of tomorrow? Maybe you have wondered that should you send a hello to to your ex or should you tell this girl, you're interested in her.

In every given day, we are constantly making choices, buying cereals, choosing restaurant to eat, or which movie should you watch on netflix or even if you should opt in for surgery for cancer. Now the choices good or bad, will decide the impact it will going to have on your life.
